I'm teaching English as a foreign language and one of my students hasn't been attending for a year. When he finally came, I gave him an essay to write. He wrote it in perfect German because he thought that we were studying German. The guy had been learning German all year long only to learn that we were studying English. This is both the smartest and the stupidest thing I can imagine.he a little confused, but he got the spiritEr ein bisschen verwirrt, aber er hat den Geist.Er ist* ein bisschen verwirrt, aber er hat den Geist.

But i believe the sentence in itself is a bit wrong.

LolzProbably something like "Er ist ein bisschen verwirrt, aber er hat die richtige Einstellung " as far as I know you cant really translate spirit to german .



Did he fail the class?He didn't. I gave him a C because if he managed to learn German on such a good level in a year, he would have no problems learning English.Or you're tricked and he was raised bilingual because of his German grandparents. This was his plan all alongI had a Puerto Rican roommate in college who took introductory Spanish for credit because "he grew up speaking English at home." Let's just say he must have had a really good professor, because he learned it very fast.I had a bunch of people like that when I took intro Russian. The professor must have been even better, seeing as they learned even faster than he taught!I needed to fulfill a foreign language requirement for my bio degree. My very Russian name obviously wasn‚Äôt enough of a giveaway.
A friend took Korean in college even though he spoke it at about the level of a thirteen year old because his mom was from there. He said the reason was that he was basically illiterate so wanted to learn to read and write it.

What is a good strategy for self-learning a new language?Learn grammar as a system and make a lot of tables and graphics.
Listen more, you can also try playing dialogue-heavy RPGs like fallout. Watching popsci or little reports about the life in the country where your target language is spoken helps too.
Learn the IPA and the phonetic system of your target language. This way you'll have much fewer mistakes in pronunciation.
Watch a movie in that language and use subtitles.

My wife is hearing impaired and uses closed captions. All 4 of my kids read at a grade 5 level in kindergarten.
Wtf. The guy didn‚Äôt learn any English and you gave him a C??

You‚Äôre essentially saying he passed English by speaking German..?More or lessen.Mehr oder weniger.Your English is superb. C+


Oh wow, that's very nice of you! Wish that there would be more teachers like that.I disagree, if the kid actually showed up to class and learned the required material, that would warrant a passing grade. What this teacher did is let this kid skip the entire class and pass because he was good at a different language. What if he was already fluent in German? I don‚Äôt understand how people on this sub think this is ok behaviorYeah. The kid has a c in a language he doesn't speak. This is not setting the kid up for success later. People are going to assume he knows passable english.



In  high school I took 3 years of German, and then in my senior year I switched to Italian for some reason. The same teacher taught both Italian and German. At one point during the year, we had a basic homework assignment, just simple questions that we were supposed to write answers for, you know the type. Making sure we can read basic Italian words and respond with basic ones. I answered the entire thing in German by mistake. He did give me full marks on it  because he said in order for me to do that, and do it correctly, it was obvious that I was understanding the Italian, translating it to English, and then translating that to German, so it did show an understanding of the language. 

I had to keep reminding myself the rest of the year to make sure I was, in fact, writing in the correct language.
poor guy just forgot the "anglo-" in front of "saxon"Not quite what I was going for but, I‚Äôll take it üòÇüòÇ
What was the student's native language?Russian



In a college music history class, we were discussing the differences in sound between a harpsichord from the High Baroque and today's grand piano.

One student, who normally contributed little, said:

"The reason the 2 instruments sound so different is because harpsichord strings are *plucked* by quills, whereas piano strings are *struck* by hammers - and, you'd make different sounds, too, if *plucked* or *struck*!"THAT!!! Is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for.

Thank you for your contribution!My pleasure - and thank you, too, for posting this question!

For anyone interested, here's a pic of the harpsichord's strings plucked by quills:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpsichord#/media/File:MDMB_418,_detall_de_clavic√®mbal,_Christian_Zell,_Museu_de_la_M√∫sica_de_Barcelona.jpg
"It's a harp!"

"Lyre!"No, it really is.
I had no idea harpsichord strings were plucked by quills.Ya, they're like mechanical harps, whereas Pianos are mechanical dulcimers.Well shit, it‚Äôs right there in the name.Yeah, dulcimer --&gt; piano. Anyone with a brain could see that.

Clavichords are interesting too! They're somewhat similar to piano, but instead, there's a little metal blade that strikes the strings, and by rocking your finger back and forth on the key, you can create vibrato (Bebung).This technically classifies the harpsichord as a stringed instrument, while the piano is classified as percussion.



Elementary School. I worked in the school admin office for a while. We had a cop come in to speak to the kids, basically to warn them on the dangers of strangers and random people speaking to them in the street. The cop was great and told the kids how they should always be careful and that some bad men might take them away from their mummies and daddies. One kid puts his hand up and asks the question ‚Äúso what will happen if we go with one of these stranger men?‚Äù. The cop wasnt prepared for that question and just said how sad it would be and how his parents would miss him. 

A few days later a new buzzword was going around the school which phonetically sounded like ‚Äúpeed-or-file‚Äù. The kid had looked up online or spoke to someone and then told the other kids in schools about what paedophiles do. It scared the hell out of some of the kids and the principal had to come to each class to calm the kids down.That kid probably did more to make sure no one left the school with a stranger than the cops.What's sad is they never said WHY, nor did they explain that it's bad for family to do too, since you know. (Abuse, sexual or otherwise, is much more likely from family than the rando on the street.)Yeah I have no idea how the school would even try to explain that to kids. You can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt even leave with family because statistically you‚Äôre more likely to be abused by them than strangers‚Äù. More likely they‚Äôd say you can only leave with family if you have school office permission.I‚Äôve told my four year old in basic details what a bad person would do to them, since he asked. There are ways of providing high level, kid friendly detail without providing it in complete depth.



You guys have cops coming to school to scare children?!I‚Äôm a product of the nineties and we had this every year. Stranger danger was the rage. The upside is the fire department came on the same day and they would fill up the gym with smoke machines and have you crawl around in the smoke.&gt; Stranger danger was the rage. 

If the pedophiles weren't coming for us, it would be the Satanic cults. Thank goodness I got out of the 90s alive.And we had D.A.R.E to teach us there's a variety of drugs lurking around every corner.I see so many D.A.R.E. shirts at raves when I'm fucked up on LSD and Molly.

Shit, we never had the fog machine thing. They just showed us photos and videos of all the ways we were going to die in a house fire.
In Canada they introduced a program called block parents. You applied to be a block parent and would go through a police screening check. Then they would place this red and white sign of an adult holding a child's hand in your window. The sign indicated to kids that if something went wrong they could knock on that person's door and ask for help.

I remember the program being pushed heavily in the 90s because of the stranger danger craze.Am I correct in remembering they had to shut that program down because to register to be a block parent you didnt have to do a background check or anything so paedophiles we're putting them up to lure children into their home. 
Or was that just childhood rumors?

We had the DARE program and stranger danger presentations. I remember I couldn‚Äôt wait to try cocaine after the DARE cop made it sound so exciting. I was in 3rd grade. In hindsight, I don‚Äôt think that program was very effective...
Yeah, or at least it was growing up in the mid 00's. We would have cops preaching about stranger danger, firefighters showing off gruesome videos to children, and the generic anti-drug guy.This is your brain on DRUGS
Have you never heard of DARE?We still have the old DARE signs around town where I live. They are getting rather faded though.
I feel like it's more important to teach kids the dangers of talking to cops.

&gt; some bad men might take them away from their mummies and daddies

Thankfully bad women would never, ever do that. -_-I remember some cases, when pedophile's female relatives basically helped them capture kids. Kids were completely unprepared for thisOff the top of my head you've got Fred and Rose West in England and the Ken and Barbie murderers in Canada.Myra Hindley &amp; Ian Brady.


Oh they do, sometimes they're teachers, and men often say how lucky the kid is.  . .

Don't believe this is a big problem? It's been so entrenched in our culture that Van Halen wrote a whole song about it.



May or may not be dumb, but my friend and I went to her uncle's house which had this piece of paper framed and put on the wall. It was a 0/20 on a true or false quiz. Her uncle was a professor and was just too impressed by such an achievement that he had to put it in his home.Idk, man. IMO, the only way someone misses every answer on a true or false quiz, or something similar, is if they‚Äôre doing it on purpose. That student knew the right answers and purposefully chose the wrong ones. As for the reason, who knows.Nah it‚Äôs possible, just unlikely0.000095367431640625% percent if you're just guessing

'I don't wanna be dumb like my mama'

Teacher at an inner city school for a time where almost all the students had free breakfast and lunch (written about it before).  Lots of the kids realized and knew they were in a no-win situation and a downward spiral in terms of education and situation in life.  Quite a number of them tried their damnest though to get out of it. 

Lots of times the kids don't know what is awaiting them at home.  Many parents don't read to their kids or help them with homework (many just can't because they themselves barely have an education). or they are in just bad bad situations.  

One student came in and said their momma chose to pay the cable tv bill over the hot water bill, and another week they mom shot themselves in the hand with a gun she borrowed from some guy.  Later the same mom chose to pay her cell phone bill over electricity....and that student had enough and decided to start studying and try to climb out.  There is hope!Those were my sentiments. I wasn't inner city, just Fundi Christian. I knew the women in my community were a. stupid beyond belief, and b. fucked for life because of that. It's why I was at the top of every class I had. I didn't want to be some bovine baby pusher who sat in her rancidly filthy house while her husband worked three jobs to 'be the head of the household', poorly supervising her nine kids while her hyper-responsible two oldest daughters do the actual parenting, homeschooling them all to a barely-reading level, and just getting fatter, angrier, and dumber every year.That is just about the bleakest description of that subset of people I've ever read.This is just about the most accurate description I've ever read. Knowledge is power! Thanks School House Rock!Conjunction junction, what's your function?I‚Äôm just a bill...
I'm just a bill. Yes, I'm only a bill
Haha, it sprang from the mind of an eight year old. When you have ten more years to go before escaping, you have time to pick apart everything you hate about anything.
Sounds like you were one of those siblings. Im also so angry at any parent that makes their children to take that role. Its ok if its a 15 min on the rare occasion, baby sitting is great and fine after 16 and they agree to it. But I've live in and seen that situation too much to know how the kids feel and effects them on a deep level.

I'm glad for that kid :)&gt; Many parents don't read to their kids or help them with homework (many just can't because they themselves barely have an education). or they are in just bad bad situations.

Honestly, I don't think that most middle class parents read to their children or help with homework either.Maybe not but I think almost every kid who was successful in school had a parent who made sure they were doing what they needed to do in school. 

It's the kids who don't care with parents who don't care that get poor grades. Someone has to give a fuck, the school can only do so much.I had *terrible* math teachers growing up, yet video games made me love math. As a math nerd who is getting married in a month and plans to have kids a couple of years from now, I can't wait for my futurelings to need help with math homework so that I can finally conquer what gave me so much anguish all those years ago.It's harder than it looks. Even if you get the answer, communicating it is a whole other challenge. I'm currently getting a Bachelor's in Math, but whenever I try to help my little sister (high school freshman) with her math homework, I struggle to explain the answer in a way she understands.




When learning mythology

Mister, if centaurs have 2 arms and 4 legs, does that make them insects?So, Goro from Mortal Kombat is a Insect!Motaro actuallyGoro has 4 arms and 2 legs so also an insect. I get that you meant Motaro is a centaur though.

Does it?Well insects have a head, thorax, and abdomen. 6 legs, they can have wings (but don‚Äôt always) and an exoskeleton. There‚Äôs obviously more, but I‚Äôd have to say no. A Centaur is not an insect.Of course it isn't. It's a mythological being.Mythological being can be insect though.I'm pretty sure that's a myth.Insects aren't myths though, I've seen them before in books, museums, and even in video games


Many of the people you see every day are actually half-centaurs.

I'm gonna make those modifications and I'm have my next D&amp;D monster.
This guy asking the real questions
Better question. Does it have human lungs or massive horse lungs?
No, because insects need to have 3 body segments and they only have 1Head, abs, horsey bits.

There's three.Centaurs are now insects. They plague your life and bother you every waking and sleeping moment. Attempts to get rid of them only strengthen their numbers. They enter through every hole in your house and poop horsey poops all over your face while you sleep.



I've mentioned this before. And also it is genuinely difficult to tell who is the stupidest. Kids are smart some days and clueless others. Some grow out of it. Anyway, we were talking about cheetahs being the fastest land mammal. Some inner-city kid swells up and says he can beat a cheetah in a race. The class laughs. Kid doesn't let it go. Finally he just says "I can beat a FAT cheetah in a race." I'm just thinking, "maybe?"To be fair, it depends entirely on the distance of said race.


I teach 1st grade so many not as dramatic as other replies.   

I had a kid who is kind of never quite paying attentions. We read a dinosaur book and were answering VERY basic 1st grade questions in the back of the book. It literally had a brachiosaurus and said:   

The dinosaur's legs are:   

a) long   

b) short   

He pretty much got stuck here and didn't move on. To me, it was the easiest question in the book but some of the students are low level English learners so it is possible he just couldn't understand the words long or short. After like 7 minutes of doing my rounds and assisting other students, I came back to him. He had written in:   

c) "Long" and "short" are both opinion words.That sounds intelligent but having never seen a brachiosaurus, it‚Äôs hard to tell üòÇüòÇ[Brachiosaurus](https://www.google.com/search?q=brachiosaurus&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enKR807KR807&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNSbpgjhn_V-xvcX7F1SdTUgfZhJ8w:1567861374628&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=PfAKPp3JZ0bMQM%253A%252CkRvDdg6n4Zy8VM%252C%252Fm%252F02_kq3&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kS61hv-ZezjDhgtG8r3xk4YllA77g&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjBvKri4r7kAhWOfd4KHZzYBgwQ_B0wGnoECAgQAw#imgrc=PfAKPp3JZ0bMQM:)

The answer was long. Or so I thought...but I think he was right.He‚Äôs right. From that image it appears that his back legs are fairly short while his front legs are pretty long.However, compared to his neck his legs are tiny in comparison, so kid is genius level smart.ExactlyThe concepts of "short" and "long" are not absolute. What he was saying was that questions that ask for a factual answer can't be subjective. He did turn out to be pretty bright.




Makes sense to me, long or short compared to what?


When I was teaching grade 5 a few years back, I had a student who really struggled academically and misbehaved a lot. During one of his "punishments" which was washing dishes with me from our morning breakfast time, I straight up asked him why he kept getting into trouble.

The boy admitting that he just knew that if he misbehaved he would get to spend time with me 1:1, and we would talk about life and his hobbies and such.

I found out later on that his father had been incarcerated for pretty much the entirety of the boy's life.

So, the 'stupidest' and most misbehaved kid in the class was actually just playing the system the whole time, and really just needed a positive male role model in his life. 

After that, I told him he didn't need to act up in order to spend time with me. He could just ask for extra responsibility and I would give it to him. He was (mostly) better behaved after that.

I miss him, a lot.

Fifth grader: gets negative for a volume answer. Me: negative volume? Think about that for a minute. Fifth grader: couldn't that be for a black hole?He's incorrect ofc, but based on what he knows, that is some reeaaaal lateral thinking. 

In that position, I wouldn't really know what to do. Can't want to say he's right, but I want to get the point across that he was really clever.I think those either have infinite volume or none at all. 

Someone call a scientist.The singularity itself doesn't have a volume (kind of by definition). The event horizon, however, does have a positive volume, which depends on the black hole's mass and rate of rotation.


2 incidents come to mind.

Kids (10&amp;11 year olds) having a disagreement on their group assignment. I instinctively call out the naughty kid (whose whingey voice is ingrained in my brain and is the first voice i notice). He jumps up and screams that his group are egotistical assholes who cant even decide on a topic two days into their assignment. Was impressed by his vocabulary but more so that the small amount that had been done on the assignment already was completely his. Still had to send him to the principal.


I was on prac in a class of 7-8 year olds. A pair of girls  gave me a drawing and said i was really pretty. Another girl who seemed to be from a lower class family compared to her classmates and had learning delays heard this and came up to me saying 'i dont think you are pretty'. I was taken aback but kids are kids and dont always have filters. She saw the look on my face and followed up quickly saying 'I think you are kind and smart. Being pretty doesnt matter, girls can be more than pretty. Are you going to stay as our teacher forever?'

And that was the moment I knew this profession was for me.Aww ü•∞ so brilliantly forward thinking.Still, I bet you were a little crushed that you weren‚Äôt pretty though.Haha no I was totally inspired in the moment and was like 'fuck yea, i am all kinds of amazing!'

well that made me cry a little.

Hmmm, I hate the word in describing this kiddo, and it wasn't so much what she said, but did. She certainly wasn't stupid, but as an at-risk youth counselor I can say she was very low functioning. She went AWOL one night outta the blue. Not one staff saw her leave. Usually when this happens, kids go do dumb kid stuff like going to a park to drink and smoke; teenage shit. Well, we didn't see her for two days! We finnaly got a phone call from a person who had taken her in, *four hundred some miles away*. When she got back to our facility she had this nervous look, knowing I was gonna scold her. I didn't, I was to fucking impressed! I asked her how she did it, and she said she kept hopping busses. I guess none of the drivers had the heart to kick her off, so there she went. I took a very big risk in the fact that I congratulated her on her journey. Her eyes lit up when I told her she had managed to travel farther then any kid that had ever gone AWOL. She never did it again and actually graduated the program with sucess. Still a booger, but I'll always remember that booger.I support a guy who used to go to his day program, spend his bus money on pop, and just get on the bus without money or a ticket. The drivers also didn't have the heart to kick him off, but his primary support people eventually just paid for bus tickets ahead of time. It never occured to me just how poorly that could have turned out (he's non-verbal, so it wouldn't have been easy had he gotten out of town).
Damn, that reminds me of the time a kid in my shitty Christian school decided she was fecking done with it all, and disappeared for 2 weeks.

She would later call her family from fucking Mexico. We lived in Virginia.


‚ÄúI remember ‚Äòcircumference‚Äô because it sounds like ‚Äòcircumcised‚Äô!‚ÄùO_oThis is actually how my 10th grade Geometry teacher told us to remember


Computer science.
X = a notable local event that involves walking to every bar between two popular points that day of the year. 

Y = one bar in particular which has 2 or 3 companies inside of it (a mall of bartenders if you will)

To another student.."Dude, arrays aren't that complicated. It's like [X] except every bar is [Y] with infinite bars inside. You can't know if their food sucks this year until you're already inside looking at it. You don't have to eat it, but you have to look at it."Am computer person and know about arrays, but your wording is confusing me, was he explaining that you have to iterate over array entries until you find what you're looking for?Yes. The X and Y is because those are facts specific to where I live and work irl.


‚ÄúWhy can we eat some plants and not others?‚Äù. Yeah, nature - you bastard!All plants are edible‚Ä¶once.
Because some plants prefer not to be eaten by you and want to kill you! 

I mean smart question, if you think about it for less than a minute or so.


Okay so I am not a teacher but there was a kid in our class, always distracted and did poorly on the tests, just barely managed to pass each time. Whenever the teachers used to ask him questions about anything he would stand up and be completely blank. The teachers would be really angry at him but could not do anything as he was passing the classes. However when it came to causing mischief and playing tricks on teachers, his name would be on the top each time. As time passed other kids thought that he was a bad influence and the number of his friends declined over time.

This type of behaviour continued for 2-3 years. Fast forward to our second last year in school, that boy was still acting in the same way. Then one day he was really frustrated over something and was not paying attention in class as usual. The teacher noticed him and asked him a question about something regarding quantum mechanics and wavefronts.

Just like the other times he stood up and looked blank. The teacher, not looking to let him go this time, started scolding him and telling him how much of a failure he was and he would not get any job after school. 
This turned out to be his breaking point. Then just like it is shown in the movies; He cut off the teacher by banging his fists on the desk, went to board and solved the question the teacher had asked him, explained some more things to the class about the topic which was of higher level than high school. As he finished he told the teacher to google certain things he talked about as he did not understand it and stormed out of the class.

That day we learned that the person who we thought was the stupidest was actually smarter than all of us. The reason he scored so low on tests was because he already knew about those things and they did not excite him so he did just the bare minimum in tests which was required to pass.Reminds me of a friend I knew in middle school. He acted like the dumb joker. Always scored just enough for passing, usually by failing an exam or two and then passing others just well enough to keep a C. He was also about 2 years older than the rest of the class. Back then, we took statewide standardized testing in 8th grade (this was just before No Child Left Behind).

When we got our scores back, I can't remember how, but I saw his scores. Kid scored in the 99th percentile in everything across the board. I asked him point blank if he could do that why was he almost failing. His answer: "My dad will beat me if I come home with anything higher than a C." He said it with such a straight face and without his usual nonchalant attitude. 

I hope things worked out for him. I saw him once after middle school the following year in the high school main office. He had dropped out (he had passed the age where you could do that), got his GED, was accepted into the police academy and overall seemed really happy.Why would his dad beat him if he got grades higher than a C?Some people are assholes. My dad dated a woman who would make fun of one of her kids for not getting in trouble enough saying he wasn‚Äôt truly one of them.

She was just through and through a shit person. I cannot stress enough how bad of a person she was with zero redeeming qualities. Some people are like that though, and they want their kid to be just as shitty and miserable as them.My question too. Maybe dad had to struggle to get Cs and didn't want to be surpassed by his son?Not sure. I will say this was Florida though.

His name? Albert Einstein.They had me right up until the end when he walked out and nobody clapped..No people did not clap and I omitted this part of the story purposely as this was not like in the movies because later on his parents were called and he was suspended for three days. Also from then on teacher purposely called him out repeatedly even when he was not doing anything mischievous .hang that teacher what the fuck? bringing personal feeling to education at least take that license away. Since he is being unreasonable to the upcoming generation it is only reasonable to be unreasonable to him as well.It happens a lot. Kids get targeted I've seen it happen to a few

Well that just sounds like a shitty teacher. Also the kid didn't seem to want to be in school so they gave him three days off for finally showing people he's above what they're teaching? Why not out him in AP? Why not encourage a kid for what they know and expand on it instead of doing what they think they know you're going to do?

His first name was Rahul, can't give full name without permission.So, someone belonging to a large majority of Indian guys born in the 90'sReally narrows it down.It‚Äôs the son of the tiger hunter who reinvented the microwave.Damn, you got him dead to rights.


His real name... Ra's Al'Ghulinmate 4587

His name? Robert Paulson.His name was Robert Paulson. 


HIS NAME WAS ROBERT PAULSON.

&gt;The teacher, not looking to let him go this time, started scolding him and telling him how much of a failure he was and would not get any job after school

I'm a teacher. This part of the story hints to me that the teacher absolutely knew how smart this kid was before he "snapped". 

Yeah, some teachers are assholes, but scolding a kid that is behind everyone is as effective as yelling at a tree to grow faster. But a kid that you know knows the answer, and just fucking refuses to even write it down or say it out loud? That's the kid that frustrates you to the point of inappropriately calling them out in front of everyone.There is a disproportionately large representation of asshole teachers in India where this ostensibly took place. I‚Äôve seen students berated and even beaten through my wonderful journey through the Indian education system.I don't know if the teacher knew about him being smart or not but what I can say is that where I am from, teachers love to scold students at the slightest chance they get.You definitely could be right, I was like this in school. I didn't like the subjects in school so I didn't do any homework but I Aced all the tests. One of my teachers called me out in front of class for being lazy and not caring. She asked/yelled "how can someone so smart be so stupid!? " in front of the whole class.Most teachers I know who go off on students simply refuse to believe anyone is stupid or otherwise unable to learn what they teach at the time. Others see a kid they know has a good avg. score and think they can't lack knowledge on any particular subject because of it. Few have gone after smart kids specifically but even from those many do so because they're insecure and feel threatened by the child's intelligence.

The single worst teacher I know works at a rather prestigious highschool and is so insecure that he berates everyone equally but goes straight to war on anyone who questions his authority. He expects nothing short of perfection from everyone when it comes to scores and deadlines. His subject? *Chemistry.* He also directs at a workers' theatre and expects every participant there to break their backs and sacrifice their private lives for no profit on every single play.

Yes I recognise I've had horrible luck when it comes to teachers. But bad ones are definitely out there. I think they congregate. Bad staff tolerates peculiar and toxic cases instead of laying them off for incompetence. Similarly, good teachers find one another because if you're one, chances are you end up working at a school with proper standards.
This kind of behaviour is rather common for highly gifted people, they just do not fit into the regular educational system. Often they have the worst grades while they are the smartest studentsMy kid is like this. She will score 100s on her exams but refuses to do homework. She was an honor roll student for years and now she barely gets a c. It‚Äôs so frustrating because I know how smart she is.FWIW, I was *exactly* like that in high school, and in college I actually did the shit I had to do and ended up with a 3.75 GPA. My poor parents spend four years being perpetually pissed off over my slacking.

Why would the kid spend his free time learning about something he wasn't interested in?He learnt about this stuff because he was really interested in it. But he was not interested in the way teaching was done in schools in my country.
Here in exams one is expected to write the steps in the manner the teacher has taught in the class, write the same language as in the books, use the same methods as taught. Then only one can get marks, and even if you get a right answer by another method you get zero marks for it.

That's awesome.

Question: did this happen in a country where your entire life is determined by a college entrance exam score?  Meaning there's no penalty for barely-passing class grades as long as you rock the entrance exams..Yes this did happen in India(don't tell anyone!).
However Rahul went to the research field and did not give Jee.
Like when Matt Damon fucks Up the old ass math head in Good Will Hunting! 

‚ÄúDo you have any idea how easy this is for me?!‚ÄùHis name? Mark Zuckerberg.Matt Zuckerberg, Mark‚Äôs twin. He invented AssBook, commonly thought to be the first antisocial network.

&gt; The teacher, not looking to let him go this time, started scolding him and telling him how much of a failure he was and he would not get any job after school. 

The teacher deserved that shit. You don't ever tell a kid shit like that, even if you probably believe it.Smart one do the bare minimum or get more work for being smart

A student in my economics class started his final essay with this:

‚ÄúWe are all familiar with the country, Africa. Yet at the same time we know little about them. All we know is that it is hot there, African Americans live there and they are really poor. This begs the question, why is Africa that poor?‚Äù

It was just so jam-packed with stupid I had to stop grading for 24 hours.

Edit: For the record, this was indeed a college student.I think you have misread the OP.We may have found one of the students OP is asking about.

üòÆ it was ok level stupid until you mentioned it was college level üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Oh, god. It was probably my first year room mate. She took a 300 level class. I told her those might be hard, going in (I was also taking one, but I bothered to test in via placement exams to see if I could handle it). She didn't give a fuck. 

She partied every night, and showed up to like 10% of classes. Term paper time came. I wrote mine over 2 weeks. She wrote hers in one night. 

She couldn't believe she failed. She asked me to look at it. I opened to a random page and read, "who would later tie the knot with his teenage sweetheart." On a college essay. I read no more.What's wrong with the sentence?

The amount of "teachers" incapable of reading the title post make me realize why we are in the sad state we're in.Our disappointment is immeasurable and our day is ruinedExactly

As a GA teaching freshman English, I had a couple instances of cheating that left me speechless. First, my university uses an online plagiarism checker and the students know this. With one student, over half of his essay was copied from a website. He looked genuinely shocked when I called him out on it, and then told me that his mother wrote the paper for him. I explained that his mother writing his paper was also cheating. Then he asked if he could get credit for the half that wasn't from a website.

Another time, the students had to analyze a movie showing how it used the Hero's Journey as plot structure. This was an easy assignment seeing as how nearly every modern movie uses this structure. The student copied the Wikipedia summary of Aladdin word for word, and he denied doing it. He argued it was a coincidence that his entire essay was the exact same as Wikipedia's.
Most of the replies in here are not of smart things that stupid people have said. It‚Äôs just stupid things that stupid people have said.

This happened a few years ago
(I was a student in his class)


I'm gonna call this kid Devin cause it sounds like his name. I was sitting in class wasting time because lunch came next. The kid walked in 20 min late smelling like weed
(He is usually late and high in class teachers don't really care cause of the neighborhood the school's in) he sat down next to me so that he could talk to me. The teacher was sick of his shit and called him out for not knowing anything were doing and to not distract me, he was sick of the teachers shit and told her "that answer is wrong" the teacher told him that even if I was he wouldn't know so he got up and erased the answer and fixed it. The teacher checked and he was right.

This was freshmen year algebra so the questions wernt that hard but it was the first time any of us were learning it and he solved it in like 40 seconds
No one thought that he was dumb  but the quietst kid in HS chemistry would solve the complex chemistry problems in his head correctly   long before everyone else could work it out on paper.  It was impressive.
Related topic statement: As someone who has been a troublemaker in school, it should be noted that the behaviorally poor students are not necessarily unintelligent too. I have found with my own affinity for chaos in the classroom, that being disruptive and pursuing the comedy route to sideline the teacher has generally been something I did out of a need for attention, where other deficits in my life (mental health, family, home life) had to be addressed. This is not a justification for disturbing other students learning, just some introspective reflection that I am attempting to make sense of here.
I'm teaching in an elementary school. We were talking about what's typical for boys and girls and about wheater these stereotypes are really true. A boy, who was interrupting class the whole year and didn't take much interest in class, raised his hand and said: "But isn't this totally stupid? Isn't it most important that your happy? It doesn't matter if boys were dresses. If they like it, they can wear what ever they want." 
I was really proud of him.

One of my students told me he was going to be 21 when he graduated high school. I asked him why. He explained that he ages TWO YEARS every year. He is 15 turning 16 so that is 2 years. He is probably right that he will not graduate HS til age 21, but not for the reason he mentioned lol
I was making a joke about mermaids to a 6 year old - "If a mermaid is a person on top and a fish on the bottom, is a person-on-bottom fish-on-top a mermaid too or is it something else?"

Kid pauses and says "well no its not a mermaid, because if you have a fraction like 1/2 its not the same as 2/1"

I thought that was both the cleverest answer to that question I ever heard but also made no sense - mermaids aren't math.  I ask that question to a lot of kids thats by far my favorite answer.
I‚Äôve been teaching for 10 years either to kids about to be kicked out of the system or at a school with mostly kids with low socioeconomic status and are learning English as a second language. 

Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know how to gauge intelligence any more.  I‚Äôve had AP kids in my class that can‚Äôt figure out shit unless it‚Äôs spoon fed to them.  I‚Äôve had severely handicapped kids that are doing the best work in my class.  

I had a kid that has so low that I had to repeat the previous day‚Äôs lesson to him every day and we never got very far, but he could ride his bike the 15 blocks home and navigate 3 different gang territories without incident.  I‚Äôve had kids that were headed to prestigious universities that couldn‚Äôt figure out how to make a box of Mac n cheese if they had to.
I don't know if this counts but I was teaching a public speaking class. It was mostly 9th grade. They were all nervous about their first big speech, and I tried to ease their nerves by saying, "I promise giving a speech won't kill you."

Then, some kid shouted, "DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE IN HISTORY HAVE DIED WHILE GIVING A SPEECH???"
"But, if we have a gun buy-back, only good people would do it.  Criminals won't go for that, because they make more money robbing people and stuff, than they could make selling their gun."   
I hadn't even thought of that. It's like a blacksmith selling his hammer.
Please blow up I want to see some good replies on thisDefinitely thought your sentence was going some different and you were responding.


Working with a student in Algebra. He was frustrated and asked why he needed to know this. I told him some math helps with problem solving skills. 

He replies ‚Äúthat part of my brain won‚Äôt be developed for 10 more years, why do I need it now ...‚Äù

I smiled.
English as a second language teacher here. I specifically work with new-to-country students who have only just arrived in the US.

One day a few years ago, I was trying to explain to my class why we were practicing a tornado drill. Many had never seen/heard of a "tornado" so I found a quick YouTube clip to show what they are. 

After we finished, one girl was visibly freaked out but very clearly wanted to be prepared for this monstrosity. So she took out her planner and asked me what days the tornado comes to the city.

I tried to be consoling but inside I was laughing so hard!!! üòÇüòÇ
My favorite student of all time in my 9 years of teaching was a kid named Logan. Logan was this giant kid. Tall as I was (5'2) in the 5th grade, and massive. Logan also had an information processing learning disability. He processed information more slowly than most people.  He spoke very slowly and deliberately with long pauses, and just saw the world differently. 

Logan had learned early on that if he played dumb, people would treat him like he was stupid, and do his work for him. He had this look he would put on his face- mouth agape, lower lip hanging down, legit droooling, eyes unfocused, and he would refuse to speak to you. 

I figured that out really quickly and after two times of me making him talk to me at recess when he refused in class, he didn't pull that look with me anymore. It was a complete facade. 

Anyway, because of how Logan processed the world, he would spend his recess slowly walking the grounds and picking up anything interesting he found. He found things no one else would find- coins, sequins, a box of sewing machine spools, etc, and he'd bring them to us teachers if he didn't know what they were or just wanted to share them with us.  

So one day at recess he comes up to me and the other teacher at recess duty with me, and he's holding a condom wrapper.  He asks us what it is, and the other teacher quickly says "Oh Logan, that's just a candy wrapper for grown ups. Here, let me take that and throw it away." 
And Logan dead ass looks us in the face and says, "Oh good. I thought it was a condom, and those shouldn't be out here on the playground." and then he turned and ambled off. 

His emotional intelligence was incredibly high. I had a student with autism in class, Tyler. Tiny little guy, super sweet, but would have occasional severe melt downs. I will always have the image in my head of tiny little Tyler, mid meltdown, swinging his arms at giant Logan and screaming, while Logan simply stood there and took it and gently patted him on the head. 

tl;dr I don't care if its too long and no one reads it. Logan was one of the best people I've ever met in my life and I have so many good memories of him.
Preschoolers are so honest. It was carpet time and the kids were all sitting down. "Criss cross applesauce" was said in the distance, and one of the kids had stated that no one should say it like that. "We're not folding out legs into applesauce. It's more like a pretzel. We shouldn't say that."
I mean technically the kid is right ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I have now removed this saying from my classroom and let the kids sit however they want on the carpet. *This kid wasn't necessarily one of my slower ones or anything like that, he was more like my class clown.

When I was teaching 2nd grade, I had a mug that said "I teach muggles because Hogwarts wasn't hiring". A boy noticed the HP-font and asked what it meant. I translated for him and he went: "But you don't even know if we are muggles or not! We might get a letter at eleven years old!"  I was quite impressed with that quick thinking. ,:D
Used to teach chess to elementary level kids.

Would run "Chess Camp" over the summer. 20-40 kids come in every day for a full "school day" but every period is basically a chess class. Lasts a week.

On the first day, I would tell kids they need to Lose to get better, which is true in a game like chess (especially in the beginning). I would tell them "You have to lose 50 games before you can improve in chess".

Well on about day 3 I'm walking from the field to the class and see one of my students, 2nd grader, walking the other direction and ask him off-hand "How's chess going?"

And he responds "Well, I've lost all of my games so I guess I'm doing great!"
I saw some amazingly bad attempts at plagiarism in my day. These included:

1) Plagiarizing from an article in a journal the professor edited. This was a grad student.

2) Plagiarizing from the same source as another student in the same class. First hit on Google is not your friend.

3) Turning in a sophomore lit survey paper referring to a poet's use of hendecasyllabics. I have a doctoral degree and I had to look that one up. Googled author's name + "hendecasyllabics" and there was the paper. Only thing the student contributed was her name.

4) When caught red-handed, insisting tearfully that she didn't plagiarize. Her roommate wrote the paper for her, and her roommate was the dirty plagiarist! I was literally speechless for a moment while I grappled with this line of reasoning. Bonus points: this was Ms. Hendecasyllabics.
