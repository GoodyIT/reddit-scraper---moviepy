When I was teaching grade 5 a few years back, I had a student who really struggled academically and misbehaved a lot. During one of his "punishments" which was washing dishes with me from our morning breakfast time, I straight up asked him why he kept getting into trouble.

The boy admitting that he just knew that if he misbehaved he would get to spend time with me 1:1, and we would talk about life and his hobbies and such.

I found out later on that his father had been incarcerated for pretty much the entirety of the boy's life.

So, the 'stupidest' and most misbehaved kid in the class was actually just playing the system the whole time, and really just needed a positive male role model in his life. 

After that, I told him he didn't need to act up in order to spend time with me. He could just ask for extra responsibility and I would give it to him. He was (mostly) better behaved after that.

I miss him, a lot.Teachers like you are the ones that make a difference
Thank you for being that guy. I grew up with a rotating door of abusive male role models, and the teachers who found that responsibility in their laps are the only reason I made it.

I made sure to tell them that. I hope your kid does the same some day.
Fucking good job Mate. Keep it up.That's wholesome as fuck, dude. You're a good guy.This is absolutely heartbreaking. I’m glad he had access to you as a role model, and someone who was more than happy to step into that place (within reason). You are the kind of teacher the world needs.That shows a lot of emotional maturity from that student too. I have a fourth grader who's PRETTY good about applying some self reflection on her own emotional state to understand her own motivations, but the answer to "why did you do that?" Is still, with some frequency, "I don't know."Yeah, this is a lot of what makes classroom management so challenging and complex. Kids always have a reason for acting up-- they need attention, or they're bored, or they're frustrated-- but they often don't understand what those reasons are. It's usually on the adult to discern what's going on and offer solutions.



[removed]Ah, yes, the Miles Morales approach.Decembruary? 

Seriously, Morales?

He was trying way too hard to failI mean, that could exist in his universe.  Everything there is the same as our world, but just a *little* different.Nah, they show a calendar later in the background, December is the same there.


I was looking for this. Best movie

Idk, man. IMO, the only way someone misses every answer on a true or false quiz, or something similar, is if they’re doing it on purpose. That student knew the right answers and purposefully chose the wrong ones. As for the reason, who knows.

Edit: Dang. For this being only the second thing I’ve ever commented on on this thread, I got a good response! Thank you, maths side of reddit for calculating probabilities for us. For this that commented into the Spiderverse, thank you! I couldn’t remember where I first heard it and it was torturing me.Nah it’s possible, just unlikely0.000095367431640625% percent if you're just guessing

edit: 9.5*(10^-5 ) %

edit 2: 1 out of 1 048 576Sure, if it's truly random guesses. Humans are pretty shit at actually randomly guessing.I get where you're going with this but I believe it's incorrect. as long as the questions are truly random, it doesn't matter if humans can't make random choices. you could choose all true and the likelihood of getting 0/20 would be what OP said



Did you just quote *Into The Spider-Verse*?*Hey*Na na... hEYNo no... **hey**


Maybe, but this is an established function of probability. One of the ways to tell that somebody is pretending to be blind but is actually faking it (malingering) is to ask them to do tasks that have a limited number of responses, like draw playing cards at random and have the person identify what suit it is. If you're actually blind, you'll get at least a few of them right just by chance. People who're faking it avoid ever saying the right thing, to a degree that's statistically implausibleThis reminds me of a book. I cant quite remember what book, but the girl in the book is exceptionally smart, but doesnt want to show it for some reason, so at school she doesnt just straight fail the tests, she strategically just gets just enough wrong to come out average.


This. My brother recently did this too
I saw someone get a 0/62 on a Spanish midterm. All 4-option multiple choice.
The stat major in me is tingling. 

The odds of getting all 20 wrong by guessing is (1/2)^20. Logically and mathematically, this is the same as getting all of them right by guessing. But the fact that he was guessing means that he was bound to get one right eventually.


My favorite student of all time in my 9 years of teaching was a kid named Logan. Logan was this giant kid. Tall as I was (5'2) in the 5th grade, and massive. Logan also had an information processing learning disability. He processed information more slowly than most people.  He spoke very slowly and deliberately with long pauses, and just saw the world differently. 

Logan had learned early on that if he played dumb, people would treat him like he was stupid, and do his work for him. He had this look he would put on his face- mouth agape, lower lip hanging down, legit droooling, eyes unfocused, and he would refuse to speak to you. 

I figured that out really quickly and after two times of me making him talk to me at recess when he refused in class, he didn't pull that look with me anymore. It was a complete facade. 

Anyway, because of how Logan processed the world, he would spend his recess slowly walking the grounds and picking up anything interesting he found. He found things no one else would find- coins, sequins, a box of sewing machine spools, etc, and he'd bring them to us teachers if he didn't know what they were or just wanted to share them with us.  

So one day at recess he comes up to me and the other teacher at recess duty with me, and he's holding a condom wrapper.  He asks us what it is, and the other teacher quickly says "Oh Logan, that's just a candy wrapper for grown ups. Here, let me take that and throw it away." 
And Logan dead ass looks us in the face and says, "Oh good. I thought it was a condom, and those shouldn't be out here on the playground." and then he turned and ambled off. 

His emotional intelligence was incredibly high. I had a student with autism in class, Tyler. Tiny little guy, super sweet, but would have occasional severe melt downs. I will always have the image in my head of tiny little Tyler, mid meltdown, swinging his arms at giant Logan and screaming, while Logan simply stood there and took it and gently patted him on the head. 

tl;dr I don't care if its too long and no one reads it. Logan was one of the best people I've ever met in my life and I have so many good memories of him.&gt; And Logan dead ass looks us in the face and says, "Oh good. I thought it was a condom, and those shouldn't be out here on the playground."

My sides. Classic Logan.
Read it, loved it.Reddit, loved it.

My brother is about logans age in this story and has an information processing disorder as well as some speech disorder...plus he's a big kid. Right off the bat people assume he's stupid but he's actually quite bright. Because of his disorders he's behind in reading level but he excels in math once he gets the concepts down. He loves building things out of anything, legos, connex, etc. Reading this story made me feel all warm and fuzzy, it kind of gives me perspective on what his school life is like. I hope all of his teachers have the level of empathy and perspective you have.


“I remember ‘circumference’ because it sounds like ‘circumcised’!”This is actually how my 10th grade Geometry teacher told us to rememberReally? not because it has the same root as circle? feels like extra steps to meShe was a weird teacher, but her class was fun



I'm teaching English as a foreign language and one of my students hasn't been attending for a year. When he finally came, I gave him an essay to write. He wrote it in perfect German because he thought that we were studying German. The guy had been learning German all year long only to learn that we were studying English. This is both the smartest and the stupidest thing I can imagine.Did he fail the class?He didn't. I gave him a C because if he managed to learn German on such a good level in a year, he would have no problems learning English.Or you're tricked and he was raised bilingual because of his German grandparents. This was his plan all alongI had a Puerto Rican roommate in college who took introductory Spanish for credit because "he grew up speaking English at home." Let's just say he must have had a really good professor, because he learned it very fast.I had a bunch of people like that when I took intro Russian. The professor must have been even better, seeing as they learned even faster than he taught!I needed to fulfill a foreign language requirement for my bio degree. My very Russian name obviously wasn’t enough of a giveaway.They probably just thought you wanted to learn the language of your heritage
Went to high school with a dashing youn g man named Vladimir. He had been raised here in the USA and spoke perfect English with hardly an accent. Told the teachers that h spoke English at home but had an interest in learning Russian. He passed the class as a star student. 

Only when his parents came to graduation speaking no English at all did but seeming to understand it effortlessly did everyone realize HE spoke only English at home, but his parents and grandparents who also lived there spoke only Russian lol.
I don't know man, ZombieDO doesn't really sound RussianIt's amazing to me how many universities don't have credit by exam for foreign language. I completed my language requirement in an hour before even signing up for classes. (And then took Japanese for fun.)

This is what made me quit intro to Arabic. 

I walked in, half the class was talking to each other in Arabic. I knew it would suck too much to try to pretend I was learning in there while my class mates ‘showed off’ by explicating poems so the teacher would be impressed that they were raised in Egypt or something.I took Russian 101 and it was something similar (although not half the class). There were these three guys in there who were Russian, and speaking it fluently. Two of them were cool though, but the one... was awful to have class with. He was just unbelievably obnoxious. When other students would raise their hands to try to answer in Russian, he would just yell out the answer every single time. As a class we were like we get it, you speak Russian, can you leave and let us learn? Even his two Russian friends were like "dude, chill out." This one day, he got in an argument with the teacher because she translated something and he was saying that her translation was wrong. She tried to just give it up and move on, when he literally called his dad in the middle of class and was telling him to tell her that it was wrong. At this point, he was being so obnoxious and rude that the entire class actually walked out except his two friends. The teacher was a young girl (literally, we were all general college age, like 18-20) and she had to have been her late 20s at most. She was in grad school in Russia and this was her study abroad. She was very timid and you could tell she had a really tough time when trying to navigate how to handle this student. We all walked out and told her we won't come back until she talks to the dean and tells him how disruptive this guy is. Finally, after the walk out, she got help from the dean who had him removed from the class.

tldr: a guy in my class who spoke Russian was crazy obnoxious and thrown out after the entire class walked out


I grew up in an area with a large Hispanic population, and my school district *strongly encouraged* kids who spoke Spanish at home to take Spanish to bump up the required foreign language state test scores. My Puerto Rican/Colombian best friend decided not to fight it, did what they suggested, and then took the French classes he really wanted in college.
A friend took Korean in college even though he spoke it at about the level of a thirteen year old because his mom was from there. He said the reason was that he was basically illiterate so wanted to learn to read and write it.I had friends in college that did that with Russian.  The teacher appreciated having them there because they helped the other students with their conversation skills.



What is a good strategy for self-learning a new language?Learn grammar as a system and make a lot of tables and graphics.
Listen more, you can also try playing dialogue-heavy RPGs like fallout. Watching popsci or little reports about the life in the country where your target language is spoken helps too.
Learn the IPA and the phonetic system of your target language. This way you'll have much fewer mistakes in pronunciation.
Watch a movie in that language and use subtitles.

My wife is hearing impaired and uses closed captions. All 4 of my kids read at a grade 5 level in kindergarten.

Wtf. The guy didn’t learn any English and you gave him a C??

You’re essentially saying he passed English by speaking German..?More or lessen.Mehr oder weniger.Your English is superb. C+




he a little confused, but he got the spiritEr ein bisschen verwirrt, aber er hat den Geist.Er ist* ein bisschen verwirrt, aber er hat den Geist.

But i believe the sentence in itself is a bit wrong.

LolzProbably something like "Er ist ein bisschen verwirrt, aber er hat die richtige Einstellung " as far as I know you cant really translate spirit to german .&gt; you cant really translate spirit to german .

Schnaps




In  high school I took 3 years of German, and then in my senior year I switched to Italian for some reason. The same teacher taught both Italian and German. At one point during the year, we had a basic homework assignment, just simple questions that we were supposed to write answers for, you know the type. Making sure we can read basic Italian words and respond with basic ones. I answered the entire thing in German by mistake. He did give me full marks on it  because he said in order for me to do that, and do it correctly, it was obvious that I was understanding the Italian, translating it to English, and then translating that to German, so it did show an understanding of the language. 

I had to keep reminding myself the rest of the year to make sure I was, in fact, writing in the correct language.Similar thing happened to me during undergrad. Puerto Rican myself (raised English speaking household) and studied Spanish in high school. 

Studied Modern Greek in college. The professor would ask questions in Greek, and I’d instinctively respond correctly in Spanish. It was kind of funny, but I was amazed what my brain was doing. It was indescribable the quick twitch response.

My neurons were either speeding in the right lane or not going fast enough in the passing lane lol.

poor guy just forgot the "anglo-" in front of "saxon"What was the student's native language?Russian



I teach 1st grade so many not as dramatic as other replies.   

I had a kid who is kind of never quite paying attentions. We read a dinosaur book and were answering VERY basic 1st grade questions in the back of the book. It literally had a brachiosaurus and said:   

The dinosaur's legs are:   

a) long   

b) short   

He pretty much got stuck here and didn't move on. To me, it was the easiest question in the book but some of the students are low level English learners so it is possible he just couldn't understand the words long or short. After like 7 minutes of doing my rounds and assisting other students, I came back to him. He had written in:   

c) "Long" and "short" are both opinion words.Makes sense to me, long or short compared to what?Like, let's say you've got a guy with 2 foot long legs. Those are some pretty short legs. But let's say the same guy is only 3 feet tall -- those legs suddenly seem pretty darn long.
Agree. It is an opinion, long is relative and not absolute. 

1 foot long is absolute. 

"It's a long road to get there" is relative to what each reader consides long. Could range anywhere between 20kms to 20,000kms.

Fuck he's rightThat sounds intelligent but having never seen a brachiosaurus, it’s hard to tell 😂😂[Brachiosaurus](https://www.google.com/search?q=brachiosaurus&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enKR807KR807&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNSbpgjhn_V-xvcX7F1SdTUgfZhJ8w:1567861374628&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=PfAKPp3JZ0bMQM%253A%252CkRvDdg6n4Zy8VM%252C%252Fm%252F02_kq3&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kS61hv-ZezjDhgtG8r3xk4YllA77g&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjBvKri4r7kAhWOfd4KHZzYBgwQ_B0wGnoECAgQAw#imgrc=PfAKPp3JZ0bMQM:)

The answer was long. Or so I thought...but I think he was right.He’s right. From that image it appears that his back legs are fairly short while his front legs are pretty long.However, compared to his neck his legs are tiny in comparison, so kid is genius level smart.ExactlyThe concepts of "short" and "long" are not absolute. What he was saying was that questions that ask for a factual answer can't be subjective. He did turn out to be pretty bright.







In a college music history class, we were discussing the differences in sound between a harpsichord from the High Baroque and today's grand piano.

One student, who normally contributed little, said:

"The reason the 2 instruments sound so different is because harpsichord strings are *plucked* by quills, whereas piano strings are *struck* by hammers - and, you'd make different sounds, too, if *plucked* or *struck*!""It's a harp!"

"Lyre!"No, it really is.
How dare you call me a lyre!
THAT!!! Is exactly what I’m looking for.

Thank you for your contribution!My pleasure - and thank you, too, for posting this question!

For anyone interested, here's a pic of the harpsichord's strings plucked by quills:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpsichord#/media/File:MDMB_418,_detall_de_clavicèmbal,_Christian_Zell,_Museu_de_la_Música_de_Barcelona.jpg

I had no idea harpsichord strings were plucked by quills.Ya, they're like mechanical harps, whereas Pianos are mechanical dulcimers.Well shit, it’s right there in the name.Yeah, dulcimer --&gt; piano. Anyone with a brain could see that.


This technically classifies the harpsichord as a stringed instrument, while the piano is classified as percussion.
Clavichords are interesting too! They're somewhat similar to piano, but instead, there's a little metal blade that strikes the strings, and by rocking your finger back and forth on the key, you can create vibrato (Bebung).



I don't know if this counts but I was teaching a public speaking class. It was mostly 9th grade. They were all nervous about their first big speech, and I tried to ease their nerves by saying, "I promise giving a speech won't kill you."

Then, some kid shouted, "DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE IN HISTORY HAVE DIED WHILE GIVING A SPEECH???"I mean he had a point. Probably my favorite answer in the thread.Yeah. I couldn't even talk for probably 5 minutes. I just smiled, nodded, and let out a chuckle. I think said something like, "not in my classroom!" I probably shouldn't say that with all the school shooting crap going on in the US



Elementary School. I worked in the school admin office for a while. We had a cop come in to speak to the kids, basically to warn them on the dangers of strangers and random people speaking to them in the street. The cop was great and told the kids how they should always be careful and that some bad men might take them away from their mummies and daddies. One kid puts his hand up and asks the question “so what will happen if we go with one of these stranger men?”. The cop wasnt prepared for that question and just said how sad it would be and how his parents would miss him. 

A few days later a new buzzword was going around the school which phonetically sounded like “peed-or-file”. The kid had looked up online or spoke to someone and then told the other kids in schools about what paedophiles do. It scared the hell out of some of the kids and the principal had to come to each class to calm the kids down.That kid probably did more to make sure no one left the school with a stranger than the cops.What's sad is they never said WHY, nor did they explain that it's bad for family to do too, since you know. (Abuse, sexual or otherwise, is much more likely from family than the rando on the street.)Yeah I have no idea how the school would even try to explain that to kids. You can’t just say “you can’t even leave with family because statistically you’re more likely to be abused by them than strangers”. More likely they’d say you can only leave with family if you have school office permission.I’ve told my four year old in basic details what a bad person would do to them, since he asked. There are ways of providing high level, kid friendly detail without providing it in complete depth.



You guys have cops coming to school to scare children?!I’m a product of the nineties and we had this every year. Stranger danger was the rage. The upside is the fire department came on the same day and they would fill up the gym with smoke machines and have you crawl around in the smoke.&gt; Stranger danger was the rage. 

If the pedophiles weren't coming for us, it would be the Satanic cults. Thank goodness I got out of the 90s alive.And we had D.A.R.E to teach us there's a variety of drugs lurking around every corner.I see so many D.A.R.E. shirts at raves when I'm fucked up on LSD and Molly.Drugs Are Really Expensive.


In Canada they introduced a program called block parents. You applied to be a block parent and would go through a police screening check. Then they would place this red and white sign of an adult holding a child's hand in your window. The sign indicated to kids that if something went wrong they could knock on that person's door and ask for help.

I remember the program being pushed heavily in the 90s because of the stranger danger craze.Am I correct in remembering they had to shut that program down because to register to be a block parent you didnt have to do a background check or anything so paedophiles we're putting them up to lure children into their home. 
Or was that just childhood rumors?

Shit, we never had the fog machine thing. They just showed us photos and videos of all the ways we were going to die in a house fire.
We had the DARE program and stranger danger presentations. I remember I couldn’t wait to try cocaine after the DARE cop made it sound so exciting. I was in 3rd grade. In hindsight, I don’t think that program was very effective...

Yeah, or at least it was growing up in the mid 00's. We would have cops preaching about stranger danger, firefighters showing off gruesome videos to children, and the generic anti-drug guy.This is your brain on DRUGS




'I don't wanna be dumb like my mama'

Teacher at an inner city school for a time where almost all the students had free breakfast and lunch (written about it before).  Lots of the kids realized and knew they were in a no-win situation and a downward spiral in terms of education and situation in life.  Quite a number of them tried their damnest though to get out of it. 

Lots of times the kids don't know what is awaiting them at home.  Many parents don't read to their kids or help them with homework (many just can't because they themselves barely have an education). or they are in just bad bad situations.  

One student came in and said their momma chose to pay the cable tv bill over the hot water bill, and another week they mom shot themselves in the hand with a gun she borrowed from some guy.  Later the same mom chose to pay her cell phone bill over electricity....and that student had enough and decided to start studying and try to climb out.  There is hope!Those were my sentiments. I wasn't inner city, just Fundi Christian. I knew the women in my community were a. stupid beyond belief, and b. fucked for life because of that. It's why I was at the top of every class I had. I didn't want to be some bovine baby pusher who sat in her rancidly filthy house while her husband worked three jobs to 'be the head of the household', poorly supervising her nine kids while her hyper-responsible two oldest daughters do the actual parenting, homeschooling them all to a barely-reading level, and just getting fatter, angrier, and dumber every year.That is just about the bleakest description of that subset of people I've ever read.Haha, it sprang from the mind of an eight year old. When you have ten more years to go before escaping, you have time to pick apart everything you hate about anything.This is just about the most accurate description I've ever read. Knowledge is power! Thanks School House Rock!Conjunction junction, what's your function?I’m just a bill...



Sounds like you were one of those siblings. Im also so angry at any parent that makes their children to take that role. Its ok if its a 15 min on the rare occasion, baby sitting is great and fine after 16 and they agree to it. But I've live in and seen that situation too much to know how the kids feel and effects them on a deep level.I was lucky; there were only three of us. 

It’s a good thing for kids to have SOME responsibilities. But, when it gets to 20 and Counting style, where the oldest are basically the adults of the family while mom shoots out more babies for them to raise and dad works 70 plus hours a week, it is abuse.


&gt; Many parents don't read to their kids or help them with homework (many just can't because they themselves barely have an education). or they are in just bad bad situations.

Honestly, I don't think that most middle class parents read to their children or help with homework either.Maybe not but I think almost every kid who was successful in school had a parent who made sure they were doing what they needed to do in school. 

It's the kids who don't care with parents who don't care that get poor grades. Someone has to give a fuck, the school can only do so much.
I had *terrible* math teachers growing up, yet video games made me love math. As a math nerd who is getting married in a month and plans to have kids a couple of years from now, I can't wait for my futurelings to need help with math homework so that I can finally conquer what gave me so much anguish all those years ago.



When learning mythology

Mister, if centaurs have 2 arms and 4 legs, does that make them insects?So, Goro from Mortal Kombat is a Insect!Motaro actuallyGoro has 4 arms and 2 legs so also an insect. I get that you meant Motaro is a centaur though.


Better question. Does it have human lungs or massive horse lungs?
Does it?Well insects have a head, thorax, and abdomen. 6 legs, they can have wings (but don’t always) and an exoskeleton. There’s obviously more, but I’d have to say no. A Centaur is not an insect.I'm gonna make those modifications and I'm have my next D&amp;D monster.

No, because insects need to have 3 body segments and they only have 1Head, abs, horsey bits.

There's three.Centaurs are now insects. They plague your life and bother you every waking and sleeping moment. Attempts to get rid of them only strengthen their numbers. They enter through every hole in your house and poop horsey poops all over your face while you sleep.




Used to teach chess to elementary level kids.

Would run "Chess Camp" over the summer. 20-40 kids come in every day for a full "school day" but every period is basically a chess class. Lasts a week.

On the first day, I would tell kids they need to Lose to get better, which is true in a game like chess (especially in the beginning). I would tell them "You have to lose 50 games before you can improve in chess".

Well on about day 3 I'm walking from the field to the class and see one of my students, 2nd grader, walking the other direction and ask him off-hand "How's chess going?"

And he responds "Well, I've lost all of my games so I guess I'm doing great!"That's true in a lot of games, one thing that separates an average player from a really great player for any sort of game is the ability to analyze why they lost and view what they did objectively. Learning should be the goal, winning is just the fruit of your labors.

I've mentioned this before. And also it is genuinely difficult to tell who is the stupidest. Kids are smart some days and clueless others. Some grow out of it. Anyway, we were talking about cheetahs being the fastest land mammal. Some inner-city kid swells up and says he can beat a cheetah in a race. The class laughs. Kid doesn't let it go. Finally he just says "I can beat a FAT cheetah in a race." I'm just thinking, "maybe?"To be fair, it depends entirely on the distance of said race.Yup, humans (not me, but as a species) are like the best long distance runner. 

Unlike dwarves who are wasted on cross country but are natural sprinters. Very fast over short distances.Can't jump very well though. Sometimes they need a little help.Just don't tell the elf.

We never specified that the cheetah has to be alive either. That could really set the tone of the race... Depending how smart the kid is I guess.


Hmmm, I hate the word in describing this kiddo, and it wasn't so much what she said, but did. She certainly wasn't stupid, but as an at-risk youth counselor I can say she was very low functioning. She went AWOL one night outta the blue. Not one staff saw her leave. Usually when this happens, kids go do dumb kid stuff like going to a park to drink and smoke; teenage shit. Well, we didn't see her for two days! We finnaly got a phone call from a person who had taken her in, *four hundred some miles away*. When she got back to our facility she had this nervous look, knowing I was gonna scold her. I didn't, I was to fucking impressed! I asked her how she did it, and she said she kept hopping busses. I guess none of the drivers had the heart to kick her off, so there she went. I took a very big risk in the fact that I congratulated her on her journey. Her eyes lit up when I told her she had managed to travel farther then any kid that had ever gone AWOL. She never did it again and actually graduated the program with sucess. Still a booger, but I'll always remember that booger.I support a guy who used to go to his day program, spend his bus money on pop, and just get on the bus without money or a ticket. The drivers also didn't have the heart to kick him off, but his primary support people eventually just paid for bus tickets ahead of time. It never occured to me just how poorly that could have turned out (he's non-verbal, so it wouldn't have been easy had he gotten out of town).
Damn, that reminds me of the time a kid in my shitty Christian school decided she was fecking done with it all, and disappeared for 2 weeks.

She would later call her family from fucking Mexico. We lived in Virginia.Did she ever come back, or somewhere state-side?Yeah. She had grand plans, and really got far. She ran out of money, though.




I have a student in my class with autism.  He is very high-functioning but he is a couple years behind his grade level.  We were discussing the American Revolution and one of the vocab words we had was tyrannical leader.  I jokingly told the class that if I was ever the leader of the country that’s the kind of leader I would be and I went on to say that all of your teachers would be that way too.  Most of the class looked at me blankly but this one kid with autism understood what I was saying and looked at me and while trying to contain his laughter says: “Well, that’s because all teachers have a superiority complex.”  I just couldn’t help but laugh in front of the class for the next five minutes.Absolute Savage.


2 incidents come to mind.

Kids (10&amp;11 year olds) having a disagreement on their group assignment. I instinctively call out the naughty kid (whose whingey voice is ingrained in my brain and is the first voice i notice). He jumps up and screams that his group are egotistical assholes who cant even decide on a topic two days into their assignment. Was impressed by his vocabulary but more so that the small amount that had been done on the assignment already was completely his. Still had to send him to the principal.


I was on prac in a class of 7-8 year olds. A pair of girls  gave me a drawing and said i was really pretty. Another girl who seemed to be from a lower class family compared to her classmates and had learning delays heard this and came up to me saying 'i dont think you are pretty'. I was taken aback but kids are kids and dont always have filters. She saw the look on my face and followed up quickly saying 'I think you are kind and smart. Being pretty doesnt matter, girls can be more than pretty. Are you going to stay as our teacher forever?'

And that was the moment I knew this profession was for me.Aww 🥰 so brilliantly forward thinking.
Still, I bet you were a little crushed that you weren’t pretty though.Haha no I was totally inspired in the moment and was like 'fuck yea, i am all kinds of amazing!'

well that made me cry a little.

Fifth grader: gets negative for a volume answer. Me: negative volume? Think about that for a minute. Fifth grader: couldn't that be for a black hole?He's incorrect ofc, but based on what he knows, that is some reeaaaal lateral thinking. 

In that position, I wouldn't really know what to do. Can't want to say he's right, but I want to get the point across that he was really clever.
I think those either have infinite volume or none at all. 

Someone call a scientist.The singularity itself doesn't have a volume (kind of by definition). The event horizon, however, does have a positive volume, which depends on the black hole's mass and rate of rotation.

“Why can we eat some plants and not others?”. Yeah, nature - you bastard!All plants are edible…once.


[removed]You've blown Kevin's cover
&gt; I'm gonna call this kid Devin

Proceeds to never call him Devin
So his name is Kevin, got it.

I was making a joke about mermaids to a 6 year old - "If a mermaid is a person on top and a fish on the bottom, is a person-on-bottom fish-on-top a mermaid too or is it something else?"

Kid pauses and says "well no its not a mermaid, because if you have a fraction like 1/2 its not the same as 2/1"

I thought that was both the cleverest answer to that question I ever heard but also made no sense - mermaids aren't math.  I ask that question to a lot of kids thats by far my favorite answer.

I’ve been teaching for 10 years either to kids about to be kicked out of the system or at a school with mostly kids with low socioeconomic status and are learning English as a second language. 

Honestly, I don’t even know how to gauge intelligence any more.  I’ve had AP kids in my class that can’t figure out shit unless it’s spoon fed to them.  I’ve had severely handicapped kids that are doing the best work in my class.  

I had a kid that has so low that I had to repeat the previous day’s lesson to him every day and we never got very far, but he could ride his bike the 15 blocks home and navigate 3 different gang territories without incident.  I’ve had kids that were headed to prestigious universities that couldn’t figure out how to make a box of Mac n cheese if they had to.

[removed]Reminds me of a friend I knew in middle school. He acted like the dumb joker. Always scored just enough for passing, usually by failing an exam or two and then passing others just well enough to keep a C. He was also about 2 years older than the rest of the class. Back then, we took statewide standardized testing in 8th grade (this was just before No Child Left Behind).

When we got our scores back, I can't remember how, but I saw his scores. Kid scored in the 99th percentile in everything across the board. I asked him point blank if he could do that why was he almost failing. His answer: "My dad will beat me if I come home with anything higher than a C." He said it with such a straight face and without his usual nonchalant attitude. 

I hope things worked out for him. I saw him once after middle school the following year in the high school main office. He had dropped out (he had passed the age where you could do that), got his GED, was accepted into the police academy and overall seemed really happy.Why would his dad beat him if he got grades higher than a C?Some people are assholes. My dad dated a woman who would make fun of one of her kids for not getting in trouble enough saying he wasn’t truly one of them.

She was just through and through a shit person. I cannot stress enough how bad of a person she was with zero redeeming qualities. Some people are like that though, and they want their kid to be just as shitty and miserable as them.
My question too. Maybe dad had to struggle to get Cs and didn't want to be surpassed by his son?
Not sure. I will say this was Florida though.


This kind of behaviour is rather common for highly gifted people, they just do not fit into the regular educational system. Often they have the worst grades while they are the smartest students
&gt;The teacher, not looking to let him go this time, started scolding him and telling him how much of a failure he was and would not get any job after school

I'm a teacher. This part of the story hints to me that the teacher absolutely knew how smart this kid was before he "snapped". 

Yeah, some teachers are assholes, but scolding a kid that is behind everyone is as effective as yelling at a tree to grow faster. But a kid that you know knows the answer, and just fucking refuses to even write it down or say it out loud? That's the kid that frustrates you to the point of inappropriately calling them out in front of everyone.There is a disproportionately large representation of asshole teachers in India where this ostensibly took place. I’ve seen students berated and even beaten through my wonderful journey through the Indian education system.You definitely could be right, I was like this in school. I didn't like the subjects in school so I didn't do any homework but I Aced all the tests. One of my teachers called me out in front of class for being lazy and not caring. She asked/yelled "how can someone so smart be so stupid!? " in front of the whole class.
I don't know if the teacher knew about him being smart or not but what I can say is that where I am from, teachers love to scold students at the slightest chance they get.Most teachers whom I know and who go off on students simply refuse to believe anyone is stupid or otherwise unable to learn what they teach at the time. Others see a kid they know has a good avg. score and think they can't lack knowledge on any particular subject because of it. Few have gone after smart kids specifically but even from those many do so because they're insecure and feel threatened by the child's intelligence.

The single worst teacher I know works at a rather prestigious highschool and is so insecure that he berates everyone equally but goes straight to war on anyone who questions his authority. He expects nothing short of perfection from everyone when it comes to scores and deadlines. His subject? *Chemistry.* He also directs at a workers' theatre and expects every participant there to break their backs and sacrifice their private lives for no profit on every single play.

Yes I recognise I've had horrible luck when it comes to teachers. But bad ones are definitely out there. I think they congregate. Bad staff tolerates peculiar and toxic cases instead of laying them off for incompetence. Similarly, good teachers find one another because if you're one, chances are you end up working at a school with proper standards.
His name? Albert Einstein.They had me right up until the end when he walked out and nobody clapped..No people did not clap and I omitted this part of the story purposely as this was not like in the movies because later on his parents were called and he was suspended for three days. Also from then on teacher purposely called him out repeatedly even when he was not doing anything mischievous .hang that teacher what the fuck? bringing personal feeling to education at least take that license away. Since he is being unreasonable to the upcoming generation it is only reasonable to be unreasonable to him as well.It happens a lot. Kids get targeted I've seen it happen to a few




Why would the kid spend his free time learning about something he wasn't interested in?


I had a bandaid on my elbow (one of the big ones) and my student was trying to work out what it was. (It was a drunken fall). I said ninjas had got me. He said it sounded like a "nin-jury". I laughed out loud.

English as a second language teacher here. I specifically work with new-to-country students who have only just arrived in the US.

One day a few years ago, I was trying to explain to my class why we were practicing a tornado drill. Many had never seen/heard of a "tornado" so I found a quick YouTube clip to show what they are. 

After we finished, one girl was visibly freaked out but very clearly wanted to be prepared for this monstrosity. So she took out her planner and asked me what days the tornado comes to the city.

I tried to be consoling but inside I was laughing so hard!!! 😂😂

[removed]I think you have misread the OP.We may have found one of the students OP is asking about.

Ali G - 2019😮 it was ok level stupid until you mentioned it was college level 😂😂😂Thats not "ok level stupid". Thats "3rd grade ok level stupid"


When I was teaching 2nd grade, I had a mug that said "I teach muggles because Hogwarts wasn't hiring". A boy noticed the HP-font and asked what it meant. I translated for him and he went: "But you don't even know if we are muggles or not! We might get a letter at eleven years old!"  I was quite impressed with that quick thinking. ,:D
Studing Gothic Novels with my low ability, special needs group and they were asked to say how they feel about horror films. My student came out with, "I love horror films because they make me more aware of my surroundings." I was very impressed :)
[removed]Our disappointment is immeasurable and our day is ruined
